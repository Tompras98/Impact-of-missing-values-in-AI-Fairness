Hello to everyone!

Welcome to my Master Thesis with title: "The Impact of missing values in AI Fairness".

In this paper we analyze the reasons for missing values and study the relationship between fairness and missing values.
We then handle missing values by different methods of replacing them and calculate the fairness of the original data sets as well as the developed models using metrics. 
Finally, we apply machine learning models to predict the missing values and see how this contributes to the fairness of the model by comparing them with the previous measurements.

3 different datasets for UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
4 different imputation methods of missing values for each dataset (Column Deletion, Row Deletion, Mean Mode, Imputation with Prediction).
SPD metric (statistical Parity Difference) used for calculating the Fairness of the model.

For more information about this analysis look for the Thesis.pdf.
